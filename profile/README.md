# 🧠 DunkPilot.AI — Standardizing AI-Driven Code Generation

Welcome to **DunkPilot.AI**, a personal repository and collaborative space focused on defining **standards**, **abstractions**, and **starter examples** for modern **AI-assisted code generation**. This project explores the future of software development where logic is modeled, metadata is shared, and code is generated, refined, and deployed through intelligent systems.

---

## 🚀 Mission

DunkPilot.AI exists to:

- Define **standards for code generation workflows** powered by LLMs and AI agents
- Propose a common **metadata framework** for AI tooling to describe, exchange, and evolve code
- Develop **abstract models of logic**, APIs, and component structures that AI can reason about
- Offer **starter examples** across popular languages and frameworks to demonstrate AI-first dev loops

---

## 📦 What’s Inside

### 📁 `/standards`
Specifications and proposals for:

- Abstract code representation models (components, workflows, logic units)
- Metadata schemas (e.g., `codegen.meta.json`)
- Prompts and templates for AI interactions (e.g., “generate a REST API for this model”)

### 📁 `/examples`
Starter AI-friendly codebases, such as:

- 🔹 React + Express CRUD API scaffolding
- 🔹 Python FastAPI microservices
- 🔹 Spring Boot REST + entity models
- 🔹 JSON/DSL model → generated code flows

Each example is structured to show:
- Abstract model input
- Code output from AI
- Runtime behaviors and validation

### 📁 `/tools`
Helpers for:
- Validating model schemas
- Generating prompts for Claude, GPT, etc.
- Testing outputs with expected logic

---

## 🌐 Vision

We believe software will move beyond manual instruction sets toward a **continuous AI co-generation model**, where:

- Developers model intent and behavior
- AI agents translate it into executable software
- A shared metadata fabric ensures continuity, reusability, and transparency

**DunkPilot.AI** is here to explore, document, and build toward that future.

## 🧪 Inspiration

Inspired by the belief that software is evolving into a **living, logical fabric**—and we should build the patterns now that will power the next era of autonomous development.
